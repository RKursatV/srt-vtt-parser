Sorry.

190

191
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,502

199
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:10,147

write it off as a stunt

200

it into the movie.

a hard used stock car.

small town circuit and we work our way up.

205

we're talking millions.

What do you got that the 
big professional race teams don't?

217
00:21:50,974 --> 00:21:52,350
I got the driver.

218

they had half a dozen drivers.

If I had the money, 
I'd back him myself.

224
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,868
Yeah, but you don't have the money.

225
00:22:07,822 --> 00:22:11,326
Mr. Rose, you put 
this kid behind the wheel,

there's nothing he can't do.

227

There's money here.

228
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:17,073
You can't lose.

00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:24,269
So I put him to the test to 
see what he could do.

The kid's amazing.
 Yeah.

293
00:25:26,595 --> 00:25:28,269

01:29:10,827 --> 01:29:12,545
<i>There's a place on Sherman Way,</i>

899
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:14,748
<i>it's a restaurant called The Great Wall.</i>

900
01:29:14,831 --> 01:29:16,299
<i>Do you know it?</i>

901
01:29:44,818 --> 01:29:46,535
<i>DRIVER: Can I talk to you?</i>

902
01:29:49,322 --> 01:29:50,870
<i>I won't keep you long.</i>

903
01:29:56,037 --> 01:29:59,540
<i>I have to go somewhere and 
I don't think I can come back.</i>

904
01:30:04,253 --> 01:30:06,676
<i>But I just want you to know.</i>

905
01:30:06,756 --> 01:30:09,475
<i>Getting to be around you and Benicio</i>

906
01:30:11,551 --> 01:30:14,225
<i>was the best thing that ever happened to me.</i>

907
01:31:06,604 --> 01:31:08,197
Did you bring the money?

908
01:31:14,528 --> 01:31:16,372
Here's what I'm prepared to offer.

909
01:31:17,364 --> 01:31:19,617
You give me the money, the girl is safe.

910
01:31:20,534 --> 01:31:22,377
Forever.
Nobody knows about her.

911
01:31:22,452 --> 01:31:24,125
She's off the map.

912
01:31:25,831 --> 01:31:28,049
I can't offer you the same.

913
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:31,344
So, this is what I would suggest.

914
01:31:32,504 --> 01:31:34,014
We conclude our deal.

915
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,408
We'll shake hands.

01:31:35,465 --> 01:31:37,809
You start the rest of your life.

Any dreams you have, or plans,

918
01:31:43,222 --> 01:31:45,145
or hopes for your future...

919
01:31:45,224 --> 01:31:47,602
I think you're going to 
have to put that on hold.

920
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:51,568
For the rest of your life you're going to 
be looking over your shoulder.

921
01:31:51,647 --> 01:31:53,023
I'm just telling you this

922
01:31:53,106 --> 01:31:55,484
because I want you to know the truth.

923
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:58,487
But the girl is safe.

924
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:21,091
Where's the money now?

925
01:32:22,801 --> 01:32:24,519
It's in the car.

926
01:32:32,436 --> 01:32:33,733
Come on.
